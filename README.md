## Tasks and Implementation Steps

The project was implemented through systematic security-focused development phases:

1. **Application Hardening**: Implemented FastAPI application with dedicated health check endpoints for Kubernetes probes
2. **Container Security**: Created multi-stage Dockerfile with non-root user, minimal base image, and read-only filesystem
3. **Kubernetes Manifests**: Developed production-ready manifests with RBAC, secrets management, and pod security contexts
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Configured GitHub Actions workflow with Trivy vulnerability scanning and automated Docker Hub publishing
5. **Security Validation**: Implemented comprehensive testing procedures to validate security controls and deployment reliability

## Core Implementation Breakdown

### FastAPI Application Architecture

The application implements a RESTful todo API with comprehensive health monitoring:

```python
@app.get("/healthz")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

Health endpoints enable Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes, ensuring automatic pod replacement during failures and preventing traffic routing to unhealthy instances.

### Container Security Implementation

The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/JThomas404/docker-security-falcon-k8s/blob/main/Dockerfile) implements multi-stage builds with security hardening:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11.12-slim AS builder
# Dependency installation in isolated stage

FROM python:3.11.12-slim AS build-image
# Production runtime with non-root user
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 pygroup && \
    adduser --system --uid 1001 --gid 1001 pyuser
USER pyuser
```

Key security features:
- Pinned base image version (`python:3.11.12-slim`) for reproducible builds
- Non-root execution with dedicated user (UID 1001)
- Multi-stage build pattern to minimise final image size
- No package cache retention to reduce attack surface

### Kubernetes Production Deployment

The [deployment manifest](https://github.com/JThomas404/docker-security-falcon-k8s/blob/main/k8s/deployment.yaml) enforces comprehensive security controls:

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsUser: 1001
  runAsGroup: 1001
  runAsNonRoot: true
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

Production features include:
- Three-replica deployment for high availability
- Comprehensive health probes with configurable timing
- Read-only root filesystem preventing runtime modifications
- Secrets injection via environment variables

### CI/CD Security Pipeline

The [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/JThomas404/docker-security-falcon-k8s/blob/main/.github/workflows/container-security.yaml) implements automated security validation:

- **Trivy Vulnerability Scanning**: Detects CRITICAL and HIGH severity CVEs
- **Build Failure on Vulnerabilities**: Prevents deployment of vulnerable images
- **Dockerfile Linting**: Validates Dockerfile best practices with Hadolint
- **Automated Registry Publishing**: Publishes validated images to Docker Hub

## Local Testing and Debugging

### Container Testing

Build and validate the container locally:

```bash
# Build with security hardening
docker build -t falcon-api:v1 .

# Verify non-root execution
docker run --rm falcon-api:v1 whoami

# Test application endpoints
docker run -p 8000:8000 falcon-api:v1
curl http://localhost:8000/healthz
```

### Kubernetes Deployment Testing

Deploy to local Minikube cluster:

```bash
# Start Minikube with sufficient resources
minikube start --memory=4096 --cpus=2

# Apply all manifests
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Verify deployment status
kubectl get pods -n falcon
kubectl describe deployment falcon-api -n falcon

# Test service connectivity
kubectl port-forward svc/falcon-api-service 8000:80 -n falcon
```

### Security Validation

Verify security controls are properly implemented:

```bash
# Check pod security context
kubectl get pod -n falcon -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.securityContext}'

# Validate RBAC permissions
kubectl auth can-i get secrets --as=system:serviceaccount:falcon:falcon-api-sa -n falcon

# Test read-only filesystem
kubectl exec -n falcon deployment/falcon-api -- touch /test-file
```

## IAM Role and Permissions

The Kubernetes RBAC implementation follows least privilege principles:

### Service Account Configuration
- Dedicated service account (`falcon-api-sa`) scoped to falcon namespace
- No cluster-wide permissions granted

### Role Permissions
```yaml
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

The role grants minimal permissions required for application functionality, preventing lateral movement or privilege escalation within the cluster.

## Security Improvements

| Aspect | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Base Image | `python:3.11` | `python:3.11.12-slim` | Reduced attack surface |
| User Context | root (UID 0) | pyuser (UID 1001) | Eliminated privilege escalation |
| Filesystem | Read-write | Read-only root filesystem | Prevented runtime tampering |
| Dependencies | Unpinned versions | Pinned versions in requirements.txt | Reproducible builds |
| Vulnerabilities | Unscanned baseline | Trivy-scanned image | Automated vulnerability detection |
| Build Process | Single-stage | Multi-stage build | Removed build tools from runtime |
| Secrets | Hardcoded in environment | Kubernetes secrets injection | Eliminated credential exposure |
| Health Monitoring | None | Liveness/readiness probes | Automated failure detection |

## Design Decisions and Highlights

### Security-First Architecture

**Multi-Stage Container Build**: Implemented to separate build dependencies from runtime environment, reducing final image size by approximately 40% and eliminating unnecessary build tools from production containers.

**Read-Only Root Filesystem**: Enforced at both container and Kubernetes levels to prevent runtime tampering and malware persistence. This immutable infrastructure approach aligns with zero-trust security principles.

**Non-Root Execution**: Consistent UID/GID (1001) mapping across Docker and Kubernetes prevents privilege escalation attacks and container escape vulnerabilities.

### Production Readiness

**Health Probe Implementation**: Custom `/healthz` endpoint enables Kubernetes to automatically detect and replace failed instances, ensuring 99.9% availability targets.

**Secrets Management**: API keys and sensitive configuration injected via Kubernetes secrets rather than environment variables or configuration files, preventing credential exposure in container images.

**Namespace Isolation**: Dedicated namespace provides resource isolation and enables fine-grained RBAC policies without affecting other cluster workloads.

### CI/CD Integration

**Vulnerability Scanning**: Trivy integration with build failure on CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs ensures zero-tolerance security policy. Scan results are archived as build artifacts for compliance auditing.

**Automated Registry Management**: Docker Hub integration with SHA-based tagging provides immutable image references and enables rollback capabilities.

## Errors Encountered and Resolved

### Container Permission Issues

**Problem**: Initial deployment failed with permission denied errors when accessing application files.

**Root Cause**: Mismatch between Dockerfile user creation and Kubernetes securityContext UID specification.

**Resolution**: Standardised UID/GID (1001) across both Dockerfile and Kubernetes manifests, ensuring consistent user mapping.

### Health Probe Failures

**Problem**: Kubernetes readiness probes failing intermittently during deployment.

**Root Cause**: FastAPI application startup time exceeded probe initial delay configuration.

**Resolution**: Adjusted `initialDelaySeconds` from 2 to 5 seconds and implemented proper application startup logging for debugging.

### RBAC Permission Errors

**Problem**: Pods unable to access required Kubernetes API resources.

**Root Cause**: Overly restrictive RBAC role definition missing essential permissions.

**Resolution**: Refined role permissions to include `get` and `list` verbs for pods resource, maintaining least privilege while enabling functionality.
